Food pantry inventory management system from CS4400



Project Overview (from course document)
=======================================

The purpose of this project is to analyze, specify, design, implement, document, and demonstrate a database management information system called Food Pantry Information Management (FPIM). The project will proceed in three phases as outlined in the Classical Methodology for Database Development: Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation & Testing. The system should be implemented using a Database Management System (DBMS) that supports standard SQL queries. Class administrators will provide you with information about how to access a college-managed MySQL server in order to implement your database. Your professor must approve alternative implementations. Under no circumstances may you use a tool that automatically generates SQL or automatically maps programming objects into the database.
